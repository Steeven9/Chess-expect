Created files and began to think about how to structure the data: world state, cursors for players etc.

Dec 03
Added pieces images and began drawing the chessboard. Slightly bugged.

Dec 04
Changed chessboard color for readability.

Dec 05
Rescaled pieces images to fit on tiles, optimized image placement, rewrote drawing functions, improved data structure.
