Dec 02
Created files and began to think about how to structure the data: world state, cursors for players etc.

Dec 03
Added pieces images and began drawing the chessboard. Slightly bugged.

Dec 04
Changed chessboard color for readability.

Dec 05
Rescaled pieces images to fit on tiles, optimized image placement, rewrote drawing functions, improved data structure.
Added keyboard input.

Dec 06
Added end-turn keys for both players.

Dec 07
Added text indicating current turn, different cursors (active/inactive) and switched to a single end-turn key.
Edited the pieces struct to be lighter and got rid of the pieces definition file.

Dec 10
Added pick system draft and some helper functions.
Check-expect bug, solved making the struct transparents.
Refined the cursors system to make it more clear.
Added check on pickup to allow picking and on drop (movement-valid).
THEY MOVE!!!

Dec 11
Added menu and handy text with key indications.
Added tests.

Dec 12
Added readme draft
Now you can't pick up opponent's pieces. Makes sense.
Added eating function and win detection (eating the king).

Dec 16
Optimized some functions
Added momvement checks
Added the option of leaving the piece where it is without ending the turn
Added icon from https://www.flaticon.com/authors/good-ware
Realized I had swapped the king and queen all along
Removed some magic numbers and improved responsiveness (why do I even bother)

Dec 17
Packed the executables
Cleanup
Added player 2 part


Differences with the initial idea:

  Draw checkboard with coordinates system - OK
  Draw pieces - OK (used images)
  Handle movmement for two players, each one with its own controls - OK
  Highlight the tiles where a certain piece's movement is allowed - Dropped to focus on rest
  Determine if a movement would eat another piece and keep track of points - OK, points missing but not essential

  Added a funky menu-ish page
