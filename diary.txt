Created files and began to think about how to structure the data: world state, cursors for players etc.

Dec 03
Added pieces images and began drawing the chessboard. Slightly bugged.

Dec 04
Changed chessboard color for readability.

Dec 05
Rescaled pieces images to fit on tiles, optimized image placement, rewrote drawing functions, improved data structure.
Added keyboard input.

Dec 06
Added end-turn keys for both players.

Dec 07
Added text indicating current turn, different cursors (active/inactive) and switched to a single end-turn key.
Edited the pieces struct to be lighter and got rid of the pieces definition file.

Dec 10
Added pick system draft and some helper functions.
Check-expect bug, solved making the struct transparents.
