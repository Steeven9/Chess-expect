  Draw pieces\
  Handle movmement for two players, each one with its own controls\
  Highlight the tiles where a certain piece's movement is allowed\
  Determine if a movement would eat another piece and keep track of points

If there's time left:

  Timer for competitive play\
  Menu to select with/without timer
